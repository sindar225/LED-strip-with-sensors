Control LED strip with sensors (Arduino)
========================================

My idea was basically to make an LED strip for kitchen which could be control by different sensors (double clap / proximity etc), but it was also crucial to have electronics packed in a good-looking and not oversized case. As a result I came up with this solution, please be my guests here.

### Components I used in this projects:
* Arduino nano (ATMega 168P)
* 3pin Sound Sensor (Mic) 
* 330R resistor
* 16V 470ÂµF capacitor
* 220V AC to 5V DC power supply (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32808072134.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dNvvsRd)
* 1m WS2812B LED strip 
* Black plastic case 73x43x23mm (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000033361812.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dLzQndj)
